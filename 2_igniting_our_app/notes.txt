npm is a standard repository for all the packages. Its the biggest package manager. All the packages are hosted over there.
npm is a node package manager but its not the full form of npm ðŸ˜….
Now, to bring npm in our project, we do 'npm init'.
package.json is the configuration file for our node package that we just creaated using npm init.
Now, we can start importing packages/dependencies into our project.
The most important package is a bundler (ex. parcel, webpack, vite). A bundler bundles our app so that it can be shipped into production.
When we do create-react-app, it behind the scenes uses webpack bundler.
We will use parcel in our app. It is one of the best bundlers out there which will ignite our app.
so we will install the parcel package from npm by doing 'npm i -D parcel'. The -D is because we want to install the parcel package as a dev dependency.
'^' in front of the version of dependencies in our package.json means that if whenever a minor new version is released, it will automatically upgrade to the latest version. But if a major new version is released, it won't. for that we need to use '~' instead of '^'.
package-lock.json keeps a track of the exact version of all the packages that are being used.
node_modules is the actual place where all the code for our dependencies lie. Its like a database.

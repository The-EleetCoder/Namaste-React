npm is a standard repository for all the packages. Its the biggest package manager. All the packages are hosted over there.
npm is a node package manager but its not the full form of npm ðŸ˜….
Now, to bring npm in our project, we do 'npm init'.
package.json is the configuration file for our node package that we just creaated using npm init.
Now, we can start importing packages/dependencies into our project.
The most important package is a bundler (ex. parcel, webpack, vite). A bundler bundles our app so that it can be shipped into production.
When we do create-react-app, it behind the scenes uses webpack bundler.
We will use parcel in our app. It is one of the best bundlers out there which will ignite our app.

Its considered good practice to make a component such that it only has a single responsibility. In some cases, this couldn't be done, so we create custom hooks.
Sometimes, our bundle size grows huge. As we all knnow that parcel bundles all our code into a simgle js file and that file is loaded when someone visits our website. So when our app grows in size, that file size also grows, leading to longer waiting time. So, to tackle this, we split our single bundle into smaller bundles. that is, we lazy load those components that are not initially required. So that components bundle is loaded from the server as and when required. 
Lazy Loading/on demand Loading: In simple terms, lazy loading is a design pattern. It allows you to load parts of your application on-demand to reduce the initial load time. For example, you can initially load the components and modules related to user login and registration. Then, you can load the rest of the components based on user navigation.
I have used lazy loading to load the about component of my webapp.

There are two types of exports: default export and named export. There can be only one default export in a file. named exports are used when there are more than one things to be exported.
A Hook is a normal js function which is given to us by react.
Hooks keep the UI layer in sync with the data layer.
Whenever a state variable updates, react re renders the component.
Virtual DOM is an object representation of actual DOM.

ðŸš€ Why is react fast?
Its fast because it does efficient DOM manipulation.
React uses a diff algorithm (aka React Fiber) to find out the difference between the updated virtual dom and the previous virtual dom, and then actually update the Real dom.
Finding out the difference between 2 HTML codes(A-DOM) is very expensive as compared to finding out the difference between 2 js objects(V-DOM).
Whenever there is a change in any state variable, react will find out the difference between virtual doms and will re-render our component, i.e., it will update the DOM.
This is the core of react.

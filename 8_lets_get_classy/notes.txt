Class based components is a normal javascript class.

we define a class based component as :-
class myComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
    }

    render(){
        return <jsx>
    }
}

we have a render method which returns the jsx.
To access the props, we call constructor(props). We also need to call super(props). In React, the super(props) method is used to call the constructor of the parent class. This is important because it allows the child class to access the properties and methods of the parent class.
To use the props, we do this.props.propname
whenever a new instance of a class is created, the constructor is called.

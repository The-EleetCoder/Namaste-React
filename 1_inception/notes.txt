Browsers already know about innerHTML, getElementById etc because it has a javascript engine. But on the other hand, it does not know what react is. So we need to get react into our project. 
First way to get react into our project is via CDN. 
CDN stands for Content Delivery Network, which is a network of servers that are spread out across the world to speed up the delivery of web content. React has also been hosted here and we are just pulling react into our website, by embedding the react cdn link in out project.
The most costly operation inside a webpage is to manipulate the DOM, ie, adding or removing elements in the DOM tree. So, all the frameworks and libraries, including React, tries to optimise this.
React comes with a philosophy that whenever you need to do anything inside a web page, do it using javascript. 
when we use React.createElement, it makes an object, not the html element itself. Afterwards, when we use the render function, it then converts the object to the actual HTML element.

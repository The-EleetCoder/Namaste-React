In useEffect, only the callback function is mandatory. The dependancy array is optional. If we call the useEffect hook without the dependancy array, its called everytime the corresponding component renders. But if we pass an empty array, useEffect is only called on the initial render(just once). Moreover, if we pass something in the dependancy array, the useEffect is called everytime that thing changes.
For routing, we use react-router-dom.
Whenever we have to use routes, we have to create a routing configuration in our main file. And for this, we use createBrowserRouter.
And to provide the routing config to our app, we use RouterProvider.
If the user goes to a random path that does not exists, then we can show him a error component by passing it into the errorElement property.
We can use useRouteError (provided by react-router-dom) hook in the error component to show more info of the error.
To render children components, we use <Outlet/> provided by react-router-dom. The outlet component is replaced by that particular child component on the respective route.
